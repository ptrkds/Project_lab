	\hspace{15pt}In the following laboratory work an 5DF (degrees of freedom) robot arm basic operation and the low-level solution of the operation is planned and implemented. The robotics laboratory made several devices for this project, e.g. microcontroller, servo motors, other equipments. The full knowledge of the robot arm is indispensable for this project. After selecting the right programming environment and programming language all of the servo motors possibilities should be assessed with tests. The high-level movement operations should be implemented with these possibilities. The implementation and the tests should be all documented.
